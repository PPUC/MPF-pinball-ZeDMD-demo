## How does it works ?
This work comes from this tutorial of Paradigm Tilt:

> You can see in the config.yaml the hardware configuration I setup, yours will of course vary but there is no requirement for window: or displays: sections. There is one important thing you need to configure and that's the name of the dmd (under the rgb_dmds: section). In the sample repo it's named fast_rgb_dmd, and in the godot scene dmd_window.tscn the main Window has a child node (of type MPFDMDDisplay) and the node name is also fast_rgb_dmd. It's necessary for you to make sure your DMD node name matches the rgb_dmd name in your config, because that's how MPF knows which DMD to update.
